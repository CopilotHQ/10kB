_A List Apart:_ __Hey! We're hosting [10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/)!__  

_Me:_ __Oh yeah? What's that?__  

_A List Apart:_ __It's a challenge to build a compelling web experience that can be delivered in 10kB and works without JavaScript.__  

_Me:_ __Whoa, that sounds like a lot of fun__  

_A List Apart:_ __It most definitely is. Have any good ideas?__  

_Me:_ __I've got one... whether or not it's good is another question. I'm thinking of trying to make a conversational UI. Actually, I work for a [AWeber](https://www.aweber.com) email service provider so I'm upping the challenge a little to try and get this working in email. I'll let you know how it goes.__
