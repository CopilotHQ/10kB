>A conversational UI in under 10kB

## What's this all about?

__A List Apart:__ Hey! We're hosting [10k Apart](https://a-k-apart.com/)!

__Me:__ Oh yeah? What's that?

__A List Apart:__ It's a challenge to build a compelling web experience that can be delivered in 10kB and works without JavaScript.

__Me:__ Whoa, that sounds like a lot of fun

__A List Apart:__ It most definitely is. Have any good ideas?

__Me:__ I've got one... whether or not it's good is another question. I'm thinking of trying to make a conversational UI. Actually, I work for a [AWeber](https://www.aweber.com) email service provider so I'm upping the challenge a little to try and get this working in email. I'll let you know how it goes.
